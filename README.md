# Binary-Classification-Regression

Binary Classification and Regression in Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on implementing machine learning models for two key tasks:
- Binary Classification: Predicting categorical outcomes with two distinct classes.
- Regression: Predicting continuous numerical values.

The objective is to build, train, and evaluate models that solve these tasks using [insert dataset name, e.g., "the XYZ dataset"].

Requirements
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.


Description: Include details like the number of instances, features, target variables, etc.

Binary Classification
- Data Splitting: Train-test split (e.g., 80-20).
- Model Selection: Algorithms like Logistic Regression, .
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Regression
- Data Splitting: Train-test split (e.g., 80-20).
- Model Selection: Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, or Random Forest Regressor.
- Performance Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.


Results
Present results for both tasks:
- Confusion matrix and classification report for binary classification.
- Visual plots for regression predictions vs actual values.
